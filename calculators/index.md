Right now, these are all rather beta quality. **Use caution! No
warranty!** These apps work best with a recent version of Firefox or
Chrome. Most of them will work with version 11 of Internet Explorer,
albeit with a few quirks; only a few of the apps work with Internet
Explorer 9 or earlier versions.

If you find bugs or want to file feature requests or have ideas for additional calculators, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/powerdistribution/powerdistribution.github.io/issues).
